# network-java-polymorphism


* create an 'InternetRadio' class which implements the `IConnect` interface and be able to add an instance to `Network`
* make the radio be able to tune to a station
* give the `Network` a maximum number of items that can be connected to it
* add a method to our `Network` to tell how many many free connection 'slots' there are.
* modify the `connect()` method in the `Network` class so that it will check if there are any free slots before a device can connect.
